	<p>The Youth House is a social platform where we address the issues happening around the globe. 
		TYH believes that the Youth is the core element for building a better future. TYH gives voice to subjects that are important to be normalised but are being highly neglected. TYH also provides people with an open space to put their opinions.</p>
