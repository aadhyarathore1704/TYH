	<h3>LGBTQ – A part of our society</h3>
	<h4>Shashank Malviya <br>@Know your rights<br>JUN 27, 2019, 23:36 IST</h4>
	<p>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender. Over the past decade, LGBT people have gained more and more tolerance and acceptance in India, especially in large cities.
	Nonetheless, most LGBT people in India remain closeted, fearing discrimination from their families, who might see homosexuality as shameful. Discrimination is still present in rural areas, where LGBT people often face rejection from their families and forced opposite-sex marriages.
	People in the LGBT community are fighting for equal rights and acceptance. Trans people, especially, face a lot of difficulty in finding acceptance. People in the LGBT community are looked down upon all the time. This is a major issue because discrimination against the LGBT community is highly prevalent.
	People’s prejudices lead them to think that LGBT people are odd and very different. Today, homosexuality and queer identities may be acceptable to more Indian youths than ever before but within the boundaries of families, homes and schools, acceptance still remains a constant struggle for LGBT people. I have heard of people coming out of the closet and declaring to their families that they are not the person their family expected them to be.</p>
	<p>Being L,G,B or T is not a ‘problem’, nor is it a ‘choice’ as such. LGBT individuals are merely individuals who have sexual preferences that differ from what would appear to be the ‘norm’, due to differing learned behaviours and, you know, having a personal perspective and mindset that differs from everyone else’s. Saying that it’s objectively wrong for people to have sexual preferences that differ from the norm is objectively wrong itself.
	Article 15 of our Indian Constitution Article 15, 1949
	15. Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, Sex or place of birth.
	If normal men and women have the right to live in this society with respect then why not a person who belongs to LGBT can live in this society with respect. It’s not about what our religion says it’s about what humanity says…If we talk about religion as per the Hindu aspects Lord Rama had given a boon to hijras for their loyalty that’s why the curse or boon of hijras means a lot to the normal beings.</p>
	<p>I think everyone who is living in this world, either normal or abnormal has equal rights to live in this society with full respect..!!</p>

	<h3>THREE THINGS WE ALL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TOXIC MASCULINITY</h3>
	<h4>BY PHUMLANI<br>12/08/2020</h4>
	<p>We’ve all seen this term “toxic masculinity” being used on social media and in everyday speech, but what exactly is it? Toxic Masculinity is a term used to describe the exaggerated masculine behaviour that some men display and the negative impact it has on those around them. However, the term is evolving as we learn and unlearn social behaviours.</p>
	<p>Here are three things we all need to know about toxic masculinity.</p>

	<p>1.It’s harmful to both men and women</p>
	<p>With toxic masculinity there’s an overemphasis of trying to live up to these standards of what a real man is – as defined by society. A lot of men struggle to live up to these standards and expectations and it causes imbalances in their lives. 

	<br>Many men who display toxic behaviour are also depressed – they try to shut off from emotions not deemed ‘manly’, and often try to cope through methods such as over-working, substance abuse, and by expressing their anger towards those around them. 

	<br>Sol is deeply unhappy at home. This is very evident in his relationship with his father as each wants to show their dominance – Sol is violent with his sister and Tsholo, and Sol’s father is violent with his Mom. It’s safe to say that Sol growing up in an environment like that, was bound to believe that is how a ‘real man’ behaves. </p>
	<p>2.It’s probably been embedded in your culture since the day you were born.</p>
	<p>As a guy, think of how many times you’ve been told to “man up” when you’ve shown emotions? As such, toxic masculinity can only be ‘fixed’ if people are open to unlearning old behaviours and learning new ones. We need to also understand that not everyone subscribes to the same idea of what it means to be masculine. </p>
	<p>3. You might not know you have toxic traits</p>
	<p>Most people who show traits of toxic masculinity have grown up around it. This is why we should be open to learning from others because we can learn how our behaviour may have been toxic towards others even if it was not intentional. <br>Toxic masculinity limits our growth and closes us off to many experiences. It starts with kindness and wanting to learn. Speak to your friends or partners and ask if you have displayed any behaviours that may be linked to toxic masculinity. You’ll be surprised, you may have behaviours that are so normal to you that you do not view them as toxic.</p>
	<br>
	<p>What’s your definition of masculinity? If you take a step back – can you see any negativity attached to it? How would you re-define it?</p>
